# Isaac Code Editor

An in-browser code editor, allow editing and running of code in an `iframe` sandbox on [Isaac Computer Science](https://isaaccomputerscience.org/). Initially the editor supports [Python](https://www.python.org/), using [Skulpt](https://skulpt.org/), an in-browser implementation of Python.

A demo of the editor can be seen [here](https://editor.isaaccode.org/).

See the [development wiki entry](https://github.com/isaacphysics/isaac-wiki/wiki/Code-Editor) for more details on the codebase and how to deploy.
