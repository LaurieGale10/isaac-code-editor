# Isaac Code Editor

A demo project to allow editing and running of real code in an `<iframe>` sandbox on [Isaac Computer Science](https://isaaccomputerscience.org/). Initially the editor supports [Python](https://www.python.org/), using [Skulpt](https://skulpt.org/) for in-browser execution.

See the [development wiki entry](https://github.com/isaacphysics/isaac-wiki/wiki/Code-Editor) for more details on the codebase and how to deploy.
